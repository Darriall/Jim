# Jim :muscle:
### Your PT

I had the idea for Jim in 2012 when first starting iOS development and my Software Engineering degree. I used it to learn the basics of programming, Obj-C and Cocoa Touch.

What with Uni and work, it kind of got left behind, but now I've started working out again, so I need something to store my workouts in, and I can't find anything in the App Store I 100% like. 

It's kind of going to be a pet project of mine, which I'll use to practice different approaches, techniques, frameworks etc.

Ultimately I'm just making this for myself, but if other people like it, I may launch it on the App Store.

Contributors and feedback welcome :smile:


Features (WIP):
- Native :watch: app for tracking workouts in the gym without having to carry around your phone
- Progress photo tracker
- Weigth tracker
- got more to add from my notes, will do later
